# People who made this possible

This is a list of people who have helped me throughout this project, and without
whom it probably wouldn't be here at all. Most of them come from
[OSDev][osdev], an amazing community dedicated to OS development.
In no particular order:

-   [Ian 'radens' Kronquist](https://github.com/iankronquist)
-   [Jonas 'sortie' Termansen](http://maxsi.org/)
-   Lowl3v3l
-   [SirPython](SirPython)

To each and every one of you: Thanks!
