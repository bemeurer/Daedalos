# People who made this possible

This is a list of people who have helped me throughout this project, and without
whom it probably wouldn't be here at all. Most of them come from
[OSDev][osdev], an amazing community dedicated to OS development.
In no particular order:

-   Ian 'radens' Kronquist
-   Jonas 'sortie' Termansen
-   Lowl3v3l

To each and every one of you: Thanks!
